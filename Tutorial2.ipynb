    "- Some groups and organizations follow different style guidelines besides PEP8. For example, the [Google style guide on Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) makes slightly different recommendations. Google wrote an application that can help you format your code in either their style or PEP8 called [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf/).\n",

Choose a style for your project be it PEP8, the Google style, or something else and do your best to ensure that you and anyone else you are collaborating with sticks to it.
